# 4: Counters

This application demonstrates counters.
You've already seen a ton of counters.

But we're gonna go over them anyways!

1. Update the application to use appropriate tags for the existing counters
2. Add a counter to keep track of the current delta value.
   * Check the tests for a hint on how to accomplish this
   * Think about what name/tags that would make sense for this
   * Hint: You'll only need to declare this once
